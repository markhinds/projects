## Projects

### 1. A BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK FOR PREDICTING MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION SURVIVAL
- **Abstract:** Echocardiography, the use of ultrasound to examine the heart, allows physicians to image the heart safely and non-invasively. In 1989, a research study utilized data from echocardiograms on patients who had previously experienced a heart attack. Survival variables indi- cated whether a patient survived for at least one year following the heart attack or passed away. Researchers have endeavored to predict whether other parameters can indicate a patient’s likelihood of surviv- ing one year after a heart attack. However, results from the dataset provided in the UCI Machine Learning Repository highlight the chal- lenge of accurately predicting non-survival, potentially influenced by the dataset’s sample size. In response, we propose implementing a Bayesian framework using a bayesian logsitic regression model utiliz- ing a No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) sampler to predict the probability of a patient’s survival after one year.
- **Tools:** Python, PYMC3
- **Models:**
  - Bayesian Logistic Regression

### 2. Advanced Deep Learning Methods in Fake vs. Real Image Recognition
- **Abstract:**  Machine Learning (ML) has undoubtedly become a hot button topic with most companies rushing to get into the space and individuals experimenting with these new tech- nologies. Many ethical and moral questions have arisen as a result of the popularization of these technologies includ- ing the usage of deep learning (DL) to generate fake images. In fact, machine learning models have become very effective at generating realistic looking fake images and even doing deep fakes of real individuals. Issues like individual privacy and artist copyright concerns have become more pressing due to the availability of these sophisticated image genera- tion techniques. Building DL models to recognize generated images could be one step in combating this complex issue. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of traditional DL techniques with probabilistic methods to identify generated images. Specifically, we compare the effectiveness of a ba- sic convolutional neural network to an autoencoder, deep evidential regression network, and two bayesian convolu- tional neural networks.
